            <h2>About the Stress Detection System</h2>

            <p>
                This project is designed to help IT professionals understand
                and manage their stress levels using intelligent machine
                learning techniques.
            </p>

            <p>
                By analyzing behavioral data such as workload, work hours,
                and task pressure, the system predicts whether a user's
                stress level is <strong>Low, Moderate, or High</strong>.
            </p>

            <p>
                The system uses a stacked ensemble model combining
                Random Forest, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, and SVM to deliver
                accurate predictions.
            </p>

            <p>
                When high stress is detected, helpful resources and
                guidance are provided to support mental well-being.
