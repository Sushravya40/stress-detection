                    <p>
                        This project is designed to help IT professionals understand and manage their stress levels
                        using intelligent machine learning techniques. By analyzing behavioral data such as workload,
                        work hours, and task pressure, the system predicts whether a user’s stress level is
                        <strong>Low, Moderate, or High</strong>.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        At its core, the system uses a <strong>stacked ensemble machine learning model</strong>
                        that combines the strengths of <strong>Random Forest, AdaBoost, Extra Trees, and SVM</strong>
                        to deliver accurate and reliable predictions.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When high stress is detected, the system provides alerts, guided meditation videos,
                        and useful links to counseling and mental health support platforms.
